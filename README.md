# Project Title: A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment
Developed dementia predictive models based on Machine Learning and Statistical methods. 

### Dataset
This dataset is not publically available

### Phases
There are 3 phases, which are reflected in each R file.

Phase 1 -> inclusion of only baseline (i.e. first medical measurements taken)

Phase 2 -> feature engineered variables to take into consideration of statistical distribution

Phase 2 Monte Carlo Simulation -> conducted two Monte Carlo simulations on the best performing models from phase 2

Phase 3 -> inclusion of new classes which represent a change in patient diagnosis
